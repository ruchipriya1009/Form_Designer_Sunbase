##Project Title: Visual Form Designer


##Description:
This project is a simple visual form designer built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It takes a sample JSON to render form elements and allows the user to dynamically add, delete, and reorder these elements. The project features drag-and-drop functionality for reordering, and users can also modify labels, placeholders, and options for the form elements.

##Features:
Add New Form Elements:
Users can add new input, select, or textarea elements to the form.

Reorder Elements via Drag-and-Drop:
Implemented drag-and-drop functionality allows the user to reorder the form elements interactively.

Delete Form Elements:
Users can delete any form element by clicking a delete button associated with each element.

Edit Labels and Placeholders:
Users can edit the labels and placeholders for input and textarea elements.

Manage Select Options:
Users can add or delete options for select elements.

Save Form Structure:
The form's structure, once modified, can be saved by logging the updated form data (in JSON format) to the browser's developer console when the 'Save' button is clicked.



##Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the layout.
CSS: For styling the form and its elements.
Vanilla JavaScript / jQuery: For handling dynamic interactions like adding, editing, deleting, reordering, and saving form elements.


##How to Use the Application:
Adding Form Elements:

Select the element type you wish to add (input, textarea, or select) from the available options.
The element will be appended to the form.
Reordering Elements:

Deleting Elements:

Editing Labels and Placeholders:

Simply click on the label or placeholder text, make the necessary changes, and press Enter to save.
Adding and Removing Select Options:
